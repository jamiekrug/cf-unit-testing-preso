This is a demo repo for "Improve Your ColdFusion Code Through Unit Testing," which was part of [ColdFusion Developer Week 2011](http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/event/index.cfm?event=detail&id=1489920)

My slides (in ODP and PDF formats) are beneath the slides/ directory, which also contains a few example CFCs to go along with relevant slides that end with "EXAMPLE..."

I didn't bother committing the entire MXUnit framework in this repo, so if you'd like to play, just unzip the [latest MXUnit distro](http://mxunit.org/download.cfm) beneath `webroot/` (so you end up with `webroot/mxunit/`).

Happy testing!
